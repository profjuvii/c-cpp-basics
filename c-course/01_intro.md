# Introduction to the C language

C is a general-purpose programming language (GPL) that is widely used for developing systems and application software. It was created in the 1972 by Dennis Ritchie.

### Key Features:
- **Procedural**: Enables a structured approach to programming by dividing a program into a set of functions.
- **Imperative**: Allows the programmer to specify a sequence of commands for the computer to execute step by step.
- **Low-level Access**: Facilitates low-level operations, making it ideal for creating operating systems and device drivers.
- **Universal**: Applicable to a variety of purposes, ranging from system software to application software.

## Hello, World!

```—Å
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation:
1. `#include <stdio.h>` - A preprocessor directive that includes the standard input/output library, providing the declaration of the `printf` function.
2. `int main()` - The main function where program execution begins.
3. `printf("Hello, World!\n");` - Prints "Hello, World!" to the screen, with `\n` adding a new line.
4. `return 0;` - Returns 0 from main, indicating successful program completion.
